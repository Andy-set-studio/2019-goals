# My 2019 Goals

I set myself 3 goals in my [2018 review](https://andy-bell.design/wrote/2018-a-year-in-review/), which are:

- [ ] Write a book
- [ ] Get my weight to 13.5 stone (86kg) and maintain it
- [ ] Use Firefox as my main browser and write about it. Both positively and negatively

I'll update this repository with trackers as the year progresses to keep myself accountable.
